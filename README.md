# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- I built a website that provides users with comforting messages and lets them customize the messages to suit their needs.  It solves the problem of users needing good self-care options by being dynamic and changing to fit user needs by allowing them to add their own messages, take out messages they don't like, and save messages they want to refer to later.
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- They would have to clone the file from GitHub and open the index.html file in their browser to see the page and use it.
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- I am three weeks into the program.  In total, I spent 3-4 hours a day for four days on this project, for a total of around 15 hours of work time.
### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- The goal was to learn how to write my own HTML and CSS as well as Javascript files, and learn how they all work together to create a webpage.  I worked with VS Code and in the browser, using DevTools to troubleshoot and GitHub to save my work.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- A big win for me was how far I was able to take this project and still feel like it was organized and dynamic.  I struggled at the end with a few loose threads that constantly seemed to cause problems - if I tried to introduce something new after coding a lot of other stuff first, it would cause a problem with another feature or with the overall CSS because I hadn't factored it into my original layout.  I overcame this by slowing down and being careful to understand what each piece of code was doing and how I would affect it if I added something new in.  I learned that it's a good idea to go into a project with a fully formed plan, or you'll be going back to re-write a lot!
